# Book Site Application

The motivation for this repository is to create components in React. Practice handling multiple controlled inputs using a name attribute for each element and using the handler function. Practice validating the input and displaying an error. Practice passing properties to another component. Practice updating the state of the application. 

This project lets you add and remove books. It uses local storage for keeping the booklist that you have entered the next time you visit the site or if you refresh your browser.
